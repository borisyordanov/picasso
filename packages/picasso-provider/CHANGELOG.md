## [0.1.1](https://github.com/toptal/picasso/compare/@toptal/picasso-provider@0.1.0...@toptal/picasso-provider@0.1.1) (2021-09-08)

**Note:** Version bump only for package @toptal/picasso-provider





# 0.1.0 (2021-06-25)


### Features

* [FX-1956] Add picasso-provider package ([#2104](https://github.com/toptal/picasso/issues/2104)) ([8a766bd](https://github.com/toptal/picasso/commit/8a766bd174e9662e663819a3d772b757a08cc9b4))


### BREAKING CHANGES

* Picasso root component has been moved to the separate package - `@toptal/picasso-provider`. This should help us in managing multiple different versions of Picasso package (`@toptal/picasso`) for sub-applications, while the main host application would be able to share Picasso Context via the locked version of `@toptal/picasso-provider` package.

To migrate to the new version you need to change

```
import Picasso from '@toptal/picasso'
```

to

```
import Picasso from '@toptal/picasso-provider'
```

in your applications.
